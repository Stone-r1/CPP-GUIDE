## Treasure Hunt
The task involves determining the person who will dig the treasure first. We know that Little B and Little K alternate digging. One full cycle consists of digging x + y meters.

### Brute Force Idea
The brute force approach simulates each day of digging, alternating between Little B and Little K. We keep track of the total depth dug and stop when the total exceeds a, determining who digs it up first based on the day.

### Why Brute Force Fails
The brute force approach fails because it simulates each day one by one, which becomes inefficient for large values of a, x, and y. Given that a, x, and y can be as large as 10^9, simulating every day would take an excessive amount of time, leading to poor performance for large inputs.

### Key Idea
if we know the full cycle, we can get the c modulo full cycle to find out how much digging has been done after the full cycle.
Everything that is left is to determine the first digger. If the remainder is less than x, Little B digs first, and on the contrary if the remainder is greater than x or equal to x, Little K digs first.

### Efficiency
Instead of simulating every day, we use the remainder to determine the result in constant time.

## Square Check
The task is to determine whether it's possible to form a square with the four given points on the plane. The points are defined by the coordinates \((-l, 0)\), \((r, 0)\), \((0, -d)\), and \((0, u)\).

### Brute Force Idea
We simply check if all the distances between the four given points are equal. If they are, a square can be formed, otherwise, it can't.

### Why Brute Force Works
Since we're only checking the distances between four points, this is computationally cheap. All we need to do is check if the distances between opposite pairs are equal, and if they are, it's a square.

### Key Idea
The square can only be formed if all four sides have equal lengths, so we just check if the distances between pairs of points satisfy this condition.

### Efficiency
The brute force solution works efficiently here as we're just comparing a few values and performing simple checks, which is fast even with the maximum number of test cases.

## New World, New Me, New Array
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations to make the sum of an array of size n equal to a target sum k. In each operation, we can set an element of the array to a value x where -p ≤ x ≤ p.

### Brute Force Idea
A brute force solution would involve performing operations iteratively and checking if the sum of the array reaches `k` after each operation. This would involve simulating every step and counting how many operations are necessary, but it would be too slow for larger inputs.

### Why Brute Force Fails
Brute force fails here due to the inefficiency of simulating each operation. The sum `k` can be quite large, and checking the sum incrementally for every operation would take too much time, especially when the number of test cases and the size of `n` are large.

### Key Idea
Instead of simulating each operation, we can calculate the minimum number of operations directly. First, check if the sum `k` is achievable by comparing it with the maximum sum `n * p`. If achievable, compute the number of operations as `ceil(|k| / p)`.

### Efficiency
The approach runs in constant time for each test case. The overall complexity is `O(t)` where `t` is the number of test cases, making it efficient for up to 1000 test cases.

## Kamilka and the Sheep
The task is to find the maximum possible pleasure from choosing two sheep after optionally increasing all sheep's beauty levels by the same number d. The pleasure from a pair of sheep is the gcd(x, y) of their final beauty levels.

### Brute Force Idea
Try every possible pair of sheep and compute their gcd after feeding. Use a loop for every pair and track the maximum gcd.

### Why Brute Force Works?
Since n is at most 100, brute force works fine—only around n * n = 10,000 operations in the worst case.

### Key Idea
Adding d to all elements doesn't affect the difference between them. The best possible gcd is the gcd of any two differences. So max - min gives the highest possible gcd after feeding.

### Efficiency
The solution runs in linear time per test case, finding min and max, and computing max - min.

## Maximize Bananas
The task involves maximizing the product of three integers a, b, and c, where each of them can be increased individually by +1, up to a total of 5 operations.

### Brute Force Idea
A brute force approach would consider all possible ways to distribute 5 increments among the three numbers. That would involve trying all partitions of 5, calculating the product for each case, and picking the best one.

### Why Brute Force Fails
This approach is acceptable for small inputs but gets messy and verbose for implementation. There's no need to try every distribution when we can observe the behavior of the product.

### Key Idea
To maximize a × b × c, we should always increment the smallest number first. This balances the values and boosts the product significantly. Repeating this for 5 steps guarantees the optimal result. It’s a greedy strategy based on the fact that the product increases more when you raise the lowest of the three values.

### Efficiency
This greedy approach works in constant time per test case since it only performs 5 operations regardless of input values. It avoids complex branching or recursion, making it ideal for competitive programming.

## Target Practice
The idea is pretty straightforward, so there's no need to explain.

### Brute Force Idea
We traverse every cell in the 10×10 grid. If it's an 'X', we determine which ring it lies in based on its distance from the edge and add the corresponding score.

### Why Brute Force Works
Unlike most brute-force methods, this one works efficiently due to the small, fixed size (10×10) of the grid and the limited number of test cases. It's clean, direct, and effective.

### Key Idea
Each position on the target belongs to a ring (1 to 5) based on how far it is from the edge, and each 'X' earns points equal to its ring number.

### Efficiency
Each test case runs in constant time due to the fixed grid size. This solution scales effortlessly even for the maximum of 1000 test cases.

## Fair Division
Alice and Bob received nn candies, each weighing either 1 gram or 2 grams. They want to divide the candies so that both receive the same total weight. Determine whether such a division is possible without cutting any candy.

### Brute Force Idea
Try all possible combinations of candies to check if a subset exists with total weight equal to half the overall weight. This is a classic subset sum problem.

### Why Brute Force Fails
Since nn can be up to 100 and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, brute-force approaches that try all subsets are too slow and inefficient.

### Key Idea
A fair division is possible only if the total weight is even, and if the half-sum is odd, we must have at least one candy of weight 1 to form it.

### Efficiency
The solution runs in O(n) per test case, counting total weight and the number of 1-gram candies to decide feasibility in constant time.

## Cards for Friends
The problem is about determining whether a sheet of paper of size w×hw×h can be cut into at least nn pieces using the allowed operations.

### Brute Force Idea
The naive idea would be to simulate each cut manually, always halving the sheet if its width or height is even. Continue this process until you either reach or exceed nn sheets.

### Why Brute Force Fails
Brute force fails due to the potentially massive number of sheets required (up to 10^9). Simulating each individual cut would be far too slow for the given constraints.

### Key Idea
Each time we divide the width or height by 2 (if it's even), we double the number of total sheets. Therefore, the maximum number of sheets we can produce is 2^x, where x is the total number of times we can divide width and height by 2. If 2^x≥n, it's possible.

### Efficiency
We only perform logarithmic divisions on ww and hh, multiplying the sheet count by 2 each time. This leads to an efficient solution that runs in O(logw+logh) time per test case.

## Even Array
Given an array, the task is to determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the array "good," where the parity of each index matches the parity of the element at that index.

### Brute Force Idea
A brute force approach would involve simulating each swap by trying all possible pairs of elements, checking after each swap whether the array is "good".

### Why Brute Force Fails
The brute force approach fails because the number of swaps can be excessive, and directly simulating all possible swaps would be inefficient, especially as the array length grows.

### Key Idea
Instead of simulating each swap, we count the number of mismatches between the parity of the index and the parity of the element at that index. If the number of mismatches for even and odd indices is equal, then the array can be made good by swapping these mismatches; otherwise, it is impossible.

### Efficiency
By iterating over the array once to count the mismatches, we can determine the result in O(n) time per test case. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for the maximum constraints.

## Chossing Teams
Given an array where each element represents the number of times a student has participated in the ACM ICPC world programming championship, the task is to determine the maximum number of teams of exactly three students that can be formed, such that each team can participate in the championship at least k more times.

### Brute Force Idea
A brute force approach would involve generating all possible groups of three students, checking if each group meets the participation requirements, and then counting the valid teams.

### Why Brute Force Fails
The brute force approach fails because the number of combinations increases rapidly as the number of students grows. Checking all combinations would be inefficient, especially when the input size is large (n up to 2000). Thus, a direct combination generation approach is not feasible.

### Key Idea
Instead of checking all possible combinations, we focus on counting how many students can participate at least k more times. This can be done by checking the number of students whose participation count y satisfies y + k <= 5. Once we know how many students are eligible, we can simply divide this count by 3 to determine how many full teams can be formed.

### Efficiency
By iterating through the list of students once to count the eligible participants, we can determine the result in O(n) time for each test case. This makes the solution efficient, even for large values of n (up to 2000).

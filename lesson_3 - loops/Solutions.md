## Treasure Hunt
The issue is to find the person who will dig the treasure first. It is provided that Little B and Little K take turns digging. One complete cycle consists of digging x + y meters.

### Brute Force Idea
The brute force approach simulates each day of digging, alternating between Little B and Little K. We keep track of the total depth dug and stop when the total exceeds a, determining who digs it up first based on the day.

### Why Brute Force Fails
The brute force technique will not be possible because it runs the days one by one, which takes a lot of time when values of a, x, and y are big. Because a, x, and y are at most 10^9, running each day would lead to a waste of much time, and the program would produce poor performance when there are large inputs.

### Key Idea
if we know the full cycle, we can get the c modulo full cycle to find out how much digging has been done after the full cycle.
Everything that is left is to determine the first digger. If the remainder is less than x, Little B digs first, and on the contrary if the remainder is greater than x or equal to x, Little K digs first.

### Efficiency
Instead of simulating every day, we use the remainder to determine the result in constant time.

## Square Check
The task is to determine whether it's possible to form a square with the four given points on the plane. The points are defined by the coordinates \((-l, 0)\), \((r, 0)\), \((0, -d)\), and \((0, u)\).

### Brute Force Idea
We simply check if all the distances between the four given points are equal. If they are, a square can be formed, otherwise, it can't.

### Why Brute Force Works
Since we only need to check four distances, this is computationally cheap. We simply need to check that opposite pairs of distances are the same, and if so, then it's a square.

### Key Idea
The square is only true if all four sides are of equal length, so we merely check whether the distances between pairs of points meet this condition.

### Efficiency
The brute force method is efficient here because we're comparing little numbers and making simple checks, which is fast even when faced with the biggest number of test cases.

## New World, New Me, New Array
The question requires us to find the minimum number of operations in which the sum of an array of size n is made equal to some target value k. In each operation, we can set the value of an element in the array to be in the range -p ≤ x ≤ p.

### Brute Force Idea
The brute force solution would be to perform operations step by step and check if the array sum is `k` or not after each operation. It would involve simulating each step and counting how many steps are required, but would take too long for large inputs.

### Why Brute Force Fails
Brute force will not be effective here as testing every operation would be time-consuming. `k` may be extremely large, and checking the increment in sum after every operation would be time-consuming, especially when the value of `n` is enormous and there are many test cases.

### Key Idea
Instead of emulating every operation, we can directly compute the minimum number of operations. First, check if the sum `k` can be obtained by comparing it to the maximum sum `n * p`. If so, compute the number of operations as `ceil(|k| / p)`.

### Efficiency
The approach runs in constant time for each test case. The overall complexity is `O(t)` where `t` is the number of test cases, making it efficient for up to 1000 test cases.

## Kamilka and the Sheep
The objective is to maximize the enjoyment from choosing two sheep after possibly raising all the sheep's beauty levels by the same amount d. The enjoyment from a pair of two sheep is the gcd(x, y) of the resulting beauty levels.

### Brute Force Idea
Try every possible pair of sheep and compute their gcd after feeding. Use a loop for every pair and track the maximum gcd.

### Why Brute Force Works?
Since n is at most 100, brute force works fine—only around n * n = 10,000 operations in the worst case.

### Key Idea
Inserting d into all terms doesn't change the difference between them. The greatest possible gcd is the gcd of any two differences. Therefore, max - min gives the greatest possible gcd after inputting.

### Efficiency
The solution runs in linear time per test case, finding min and max, and computing max - min.

## Maximize Bananas
The issue is to maximize the product of three integers a, b, and c, each of which can be individually increased by +1, for a total of 5 operations.

### Brute Force Idea
A brute force approach would try every possible method of dividing 5 increments between the three numbers. That would involve trying all splits of 5, calculating the product for each case, and choosing the best.

### Why Brute Force Fails
This is fine for small inputs but cumbersome and wordy to do. There is no need to try every distribution since we can observe the behavior of the product.

### Key Idea
In order to maximize a × b × c, we should always maximize the smallest. This maintains the values in proportion and maximizes the product extensively. Maximizing it for 5 times is the best. It is a greedy solution based on the reality that the product increases more when you maximize the smallest among the three values.

### Efficiency
This greedy approach is constant time per test case since it always performs 5 operations regardless of input values. It does not include intricate recursion or branching and thus is ideally suited for competitive programming.

## Target Practice
The idea is pretty straightforward, so there's no need to explain.

### Brute Force Idea
We traverse every cell in the 10×10 grid. If it's an 'X', we determine which ring it belongs to by how far away it is from the edge and add the corresponding score.

### Why Brute Force Works
This one in contrast to most brute-force ones is efficient due to the small, fixed (10×10) grid size and restricted test cases. It is short, straightforward, and gets the job done.

### Key Idea
Each location on the target is in a ring (1 to 5) based on how close it is to the edge, and each 'X' is worth points equal to its ring number.

### Efficiency
Each test case runs in constant time due to the fixed grid size. This solution scales effortlessly even for the maximum of 1000 test cases.

## Fair Division
Alice and Bob both have nn candies that either weigh 1 gram or 2 grams. They must divide the candies such that they both have the same weight of candies. Determine whether such a division is possible without breaking any candy.

### Brute Force Idea
Try all possible combinations of candies to check if a subset exists with total weight equal to half the overall weight. This is a classic subset sum problem.

### Why Brute Force Fails
Since nn can be up to 100 and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, brute-force approaches that try all subsets are too slow and inefficient.

### Key Idea
We are able to distribute the candies equally only when the total weight is even, but if the half-sum is odd, then we must possess at least one candy weighing 1 so that we can construct it.

### Efficiency
The solution runs in O(n) per test case, counting total weight and the number of 1-gram candies to decide feasibility in constant time.

## Cards for Friends
The problem is about determining whether a sheet of paper of size w×hw×h can be cut into at least nn pieces using the allowed operations.

### Brute Force Idea
The naive solution would be to manually replicate every cut, always halving the sheet if its width or height is even. Continue doing so until you have reached or exceeded n sheets.

### Why Brute Force Fails
Brute force fails due to the potentially massive number of sheets required (up to 10^9). Simulating each individual cut would be far too slow for the given constraints.

### Key Idea
Whenever we are able to divide the width or height by 2 (if it's even), we are able to double the total number of sheets. Therefore, the maximum total number of sheets we are able to produce is 2^x, where x is the total number of times we are able to divide width and height by 2. If 2^x≥n, then it's feasible.

### Efficiency
We only perform logarithmic divisions on w and h, multiplying the sheet count by 2 each time. This leads to an efficient solution that runs in O(logw+logh) time per test case.

## Even Array
Input is a list, and the task is to determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the list "good," i.e., to make sure that the parity of each index equals the parity of the element at that index.

### Brute Force Idea
A brute force approach would involve simulating each swap by trying all possible pairs of elements, checking after each swap whether the array is "good".

### Why Brute Force Fails
The brute force approach fails because the number of swaps can be excessive, and directly simulating all possible swaps would be inefficient, especially as the array length grows.

### Key Idea
Instead of simulating every exchange, we count how many mismatches between the parity of the index and the parity of the element at the index there are for even and odd indices. If the number of mismatches for even and odd indices is the same, then the array can be made good by swapping these mismatches; otherwise, there is no solution.

### Efficiency
By making a single pass through the array to count the mismatches, we can determine the result in O(n) time per test case. This allows the solution to be viable even for the upper limits of the constraints.

## Chossing Teams
An array where each element is the number of times a student has visited the International Collegiate Programming Contest  world programming championship is given. The task is to find the maximum number of teams of exactly three students that can be formed such that each team can visit the championship at least k more times.

### Brute Force Idea
A brute force approach would involve generating all possible groups of three students, checking if each group meets the participation requirements, and then counting the valid teams.

### Why Brute Force Fails
Brute force approach doesn't work due to the fact that the number of combinations increases extremely high as the size of students is made higher. Checking all combinations would be expensive, especially when the size of input is high (n up to 2000). A simple combination generation method is thus not feasible.

### Key Idea
Instead of checking all conceivable combinations, we consider counting how many students would be able to play at least k times. We can calculate this by checking the number of students whose involvement count y has the property of y + k <= 5. Once we know how many students are valid, we could simply divide it by 3 to find how many complete teams can be accepted.

### Efficiency
By iterating over the list of students once to determine the number of eligible participants, we can compute the result in O(n) time per test case. This makes the solution efficient, even for large n (up to 2000).
